An aspiring full stack software engineer with a focus on JavaScript, Go and the ever evolving React/frontend space. My experience with various technologies are listed in the **toolbox** below.

I am also starting my journey creating tech content with a focus on microservice and micro frontend architecture, future javascript trends, deno, golang and serverless stacks. Subscribe to stay up to date!

I am slowly building an online presence through an open source project called JuniorDEV.life, my Medium blog and also our YouTube channel, which have zero views at the moment but I am really looking forward to building a subscriber base to pass as much knowledge to future/aspiring developers.
